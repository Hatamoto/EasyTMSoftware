# EasyTMSoftware

A simple translation memory software. What it does:

1) Takes a text file and divides it into translation units (usually sentences)
2) Provides a GUI to translate the units
3) Stores the sentence pairs in a XML file

Possible additional features:

1) Compare source units to already translated units in the XML file to find matches
   (complete matches of 100%, if some algorithm can be found to determine partial matches that might be implemented     too)
